# 📶 Offline-First Strategy & ♿ Accessibility (a11y)

This document outlines the strategies implemented to support offline usage and ensure accessibility (WCAG compliance) in the Telecom Mission Control frontend system.

---

## 📶 Offline-First Strategy

The platform supports reliable operation even when the network connection is unstable or temporarily lost. The offline-first architecture ensures that critical actions are queued and persisted until reconnected.

### 🧱 Local Storage Mechanisms
- **Web**: Uses `IndexedDB` for structured data storage with expiration policies.
- **Mobile**: Uses `AsyncStorage` in React Native for offline persistence.

### 🔁 Retry Queue System
- Failed API calls due to connectivity are added to a retry queue.
- The queue ensures actions are retried in FIFO order when online.
- Implements exponential backoff with a configurable retry cap.

### ⚔️ Conflict Resolution
- Client-generated actions are timestamped.
- Upon reconnection, the server merges state based on latest timestamps and conflict rules.
- UI feedback is provided for any merged conflicts.

### 📌 Fallback Logic
- Cached data is used to render screens while offline.
- Read-only screens degrade gracefully with fallback notices.

## ♿ Accessibility (a11y) Strategy

The platform strictly adheres to **WCAG 2.1** guidelines to ensure users with disabilities can access and use all features effectively.

### 🧩 Semantic HTML & ARIA
- Uses semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- Implements ARIA roles and attributes (e.g., `role="button"`, `aria-label`)

### 🎛️ Keyboard Navigation
- Full navigation using `Tab`, `Enter`, `Arrow` keys.
- Focus rings are clearly visible and styled.

### 🗣️ Screen Reader Support
- Labels and roles are screen-reader friendly.
- Dynamic content uses `aria-live` for announcements.

### 📱 Mobile Accessibility
- Touch targets meet minimum size standards.
- Supports platform accessibility features (VoiceOver, TalkBack)

## ✅ Summary

These strategies make the Telecom Mission Control frontend resilient in low-connectivity environments and inclusive for all users.
