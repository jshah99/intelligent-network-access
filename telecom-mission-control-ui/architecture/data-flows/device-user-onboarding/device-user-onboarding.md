# 🔁 Device + User Onboarding Flow

## 🧩 Use Cases – Device + User Onboarding

These are real-world scenarios that trigger this onboarding flow:

1. **New Employee Onboarding**  
   An enterprise admin registers a new employee and their device so they can access telecom apps securely.

2. **Device Replacement**  
   A field worker's phone is replaced, and the new device must be verified and associated with their profile.

3. **Role Reassignment**  
   An existing user’s access level is updated, requiring re-onboarding with new policies.

4. **Bulk Enterprise Import**  
   Admin uploads a CSV list of pre-approved users and pre-registered devices to fast-track onboarding.

2. **Frontend UI** – User/device data collected via React/React Native.
3. **API Gateway** – Validates and routes request to backend services.
4. **Device Registration Service** – Handles logic for tower mapping and device validation.
5. **Tower Registry** – Responds with valid tower-carrier-device combinations.
6. **User Identity Service** – Creates or verifies user identity and associates the device.
7. **Frontend Cache** – Confirmation + token saved locally (IndexedDB/AsyncStorage) for offline use.
