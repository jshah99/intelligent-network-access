# üîê Policy Reactor ‚Äì Enforcement Flow

This document outlines the flow of enforcing enterprise security policies in real-time through the **Policy Reactor** component of the Telecom Mission Control frontend system.

## üìä Overview

## üß© Use Cases ‚Äì Policy Reactor

It is invoked during runtime when a user interacts with an app via the frontend client and is subject to enforcement based on role, device, app, location, and policy.

## üîß Flow Steps

1. **Frontend App** initiates an action (e.g., upload file, access feature).
2. The **SecureEdge Gateway** forwards the request to the **Policy Reactor** and context services.
3. The **RoleContext API** supplies relevant identity and permission info.
4. The **Policy Reactor**:
   - Evaluates the policy for the user, role, app, and device context.
   - Fetches rules from the **PolicyRuleset Store**.
5. Based on rule evaluation:
   - ‚úÖ Allows action
   - ‚ùå Denies action
   - üîÑ Triggers a remediation plan (e.g., disable feature, alert admin)
6. The **Cell Tower Enforcement** module is invoked if action must be blocked at the network level.
7. The **Sentinel Dashboard** logs the activity, outcome, and any audit details.

## üîÑ Bi-Directional Flows

- **Frontend ‚Üî Gateway**: Request/response for user interactions.
- **Gateway ‚Üî Policy Reactor**: Decision queries and outcomes.
- **Gateway ‚Üî RoleContext API**: Identity and role validation.

## üíº Use Case: Role-Based Action Blocking

> A contractor using an Android device tries to install a network tool from the enterprise app store.

- The Policy Reactor identifies that the user's role doesn‚Äôt permit installation of restricted apps.
- It denies the request and logs the attempt in the dashboard.
- The cell tower is notified to prevent this device from future downloads of this type.
