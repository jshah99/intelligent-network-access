   A technician tries to use a camera or file upload feature not allowed for their role.

2. **Tower-Based Restriction**  
   A user connects to a tower that only supports certain apps or OS types ‚Äî triggering restricted access.

3. **Security Violation Response**  
   An action violates enterprise policy, triggering auto-remediation like disabling connectivity at the tower level.

2. **API Gateway**  
   The frontend sends metadata to the API Gateway, including action type, app, and device ID.

3. **User Profile Service**  
   Gateway queries the User Profile Service to fetch the user‚Äôs role, device type, and tower info.

4. **Policy Engine**  
   Action + metadata sent to Policy Engine for rule evaluation.

5. **Policy DB**  
   The engine checks enterprise policies for the current role + app + action + location context.

6. **Enforcement Result**
